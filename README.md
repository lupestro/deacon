# Deacon

This application simulates the process of passing the plate and the communion elements with a variety of arrangements 
of saints in the pews, in order to explore various rules-of-thumb and see how they work out. Most of the responsible 
decisions in the code reside in the deacon and saint models, based on information provided by the pew models. As this 
develops, it should allow for a variety of deacon models trying different approaches and saint models providing the
deacons with interesting opportunities and challenges. Hopefully, this should also be a lot of fun.
